<P>An enclosure is a box that contains a single driver.  In particular, an enclosure is completely defined by its volume (<I>volumes</I> with multiple chambers) and the size of any ports.</P>

<P>A physical speaker may contain more than one enclosure.  For example, a 3-way design with a woofer, a midrange, and a tweeter has 2 enclosures - the woofer and the midrange.  Each enclosure is prototyped separately in Speaker Workshop, then the speaker is built, the drivers are bolted on and their individual frequency response and impedance are measured, and then the crossover is prototyped using all 3 drivers.</P>
