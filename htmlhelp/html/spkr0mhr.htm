<P><A NAME="588j_j_"></A>A sound card is <I>full duplex</I> when the card can play and record simultaneously. </P>

<P>Speaker Workshop uses the full duplex capabilities of sound cards in order to test components electrically and acoustically. As a result, a full duplex sound card is really a necessity when using the product.</P>

<P>If your sound card is not full duplex (or the driver or system settings are not full duplex) then you will get an error message when you try to do anything that requires recording. The message will be of the form:</P>

<P>Can not open output device</P>

<P>If you are having trouble check out our web site (www.audua.com) for the latest info about sound card support. Most sound cards are full duplex today. Look at your manufacturer's web site - if there is on - for the latest sound card drivers and possibly for info on how to enable full duplex. Check your system settings for the sound card and driver: full duplex usually requires two dma channels from the computer.</P>
