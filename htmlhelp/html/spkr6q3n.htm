<P>Use this wizard to let Speaker Workshop test your amplifier. The results of the test are stored in the Amplifier Reference response, for use with tests that rely on the amplifier for power; these include most acoustic tests. You should also use this with a loop cable if you are using the speaker outputs of your sound card for acoustic testing.</P>

<P>·Connect your sound card to your amplifier</P>

<P>·Optimally, use a sine output (using the signal generator capabilities in SW) with a Peak meter and set the peak to about 1 volt. Otherwise use Record or loop Record with a 1KHz sine wave and slowly crank up the volume until it peaks at 16000 on the display (do this with a 100 volume to be even safer).</P>

<P>·Connect the output of the amplifier to the sound card after making sure that the volume is set.</P>

<P>·Run this wizard</P>

<P>·After verifying the data (look at Systems/Measurement.Freq) permanently disconnect the amp from the sound card </P>

<P>0After running this wizard, the dataset should accurately reflect the frequency response of your amplifier. SW assumes that your amplifier has near zero output impedance.</P>
