<H1><A NAME="1n40mj_"></A>Overview</H1>

<P>Speaker Workshop is a Windows based program designed to test speaker drivers and design speakers.  The basic file type in Speaker Workshop (the <I>document</I>) is a project tree containing many different basic types (such as folders, drivers, enclosures) called <I>resources</I>. </P>

<P>Using a standard sound card, speaker workshop can test and measure:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=512>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Driver Impedance</TD>
<TD width=64%>Test a driver’s impedance from 5Hz to 20Khz with a resolution of 1/3 of a Hz</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Passive Components</TD>
<TD width=64%>Find the value of a passive component to within approximately 1%.  It also finds the Q of inductors.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Transfer Function</TD>
<TD width=64%>The frequency response / transfer function of an amplifier can be tested from 5Hz to 20Khz with a resolution of 1/3 Hz.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Driver Acoustic Response</TD>
<TD width=64%>With a suitable microphone, test acoustic response of a driver over the same ranges as above.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Harmonic Distortion</TD>
<TD width=64%>Measure harmonic distortion in speakers and amplifiers, down to approximately .03%.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Intermodulation Distortion</TD>
<TD width=64%>Measure intermodulation distortion down to approximately .03%.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>The design capabilities of Speaker Workshop let you design:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=512>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Enclosures</TD>
<TD width=64%>Design sealed and vented enclosures for woofers and midranges using a range of Q and tuning values.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Stock Crossovers</TD>
<TD width=64%>Insert stock crossovers and standard impedance corrections (inductive rise or resonant peak).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Custom Crossovers</TD>
<TD width=64%>Includes full crossover design capabilities for designing complex crossovers.  With calculated impedance and acoustic results.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Speaker Workshop comes with a signal generator module capable of generating 10 types of signals, as well as any custom signal defined by a .WAV file.</P>

<P>Speaker Workshop has a wide range of analytical tools including:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=512>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Transformations</TD>
<TD width=64%>Including FFT, Inverse FFT, arithmetic, smoothing, splicing, and digital filtering.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=36%>Charts</TD>
<TD width=64%>Charts can include multiple datasets.  Position information for each chart is easily displayed.  Zoom-in and out are supported.</TD>
</TR>
