<H1><A NAME="9ghtbk"></A>Passive component command (Measure menu, for Signals)</H1>

<P>Use this command to measure a passive component using the <A HREF="spkr5z01.htm">Impedance Jig</A>. This command plays an MLS signal (determined by settings in the Options Preferences dialog) and then does an optimization on the resultant impedance data to find the best-fit component value.</P>

<P>The Passive Component dialog displays the measured results.  Note that Speaker Workshop automatically determines the type of component (resistor, capacitor, inductor).</P>

<P>For best results use a sampling rate such that the impedance of the passive component is approximately the reference resistance at ¼ the sampling rate.  A sample size of about 16K seems to work well.  Larger sample sizes will take longer, at minimal increase in accuracy.  Smaller sample sizes may sacrifice accuracy.</P>

<P>This command has no effect on the document.</P>
