<H2><A NAME="memory_require"></A>Memory Requirements</H2>

<P>Speaker Workshop can use up plenty of memory.  This memory is taken from the Windows 95 virtual memory manager and need not be real RAM, but it must be available.</P>

<P>To calculate approximate memory requirements for a project….</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=543>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=49%>Document</TD>
<TD width=51%>Each document that is loaded is stored entirely in memory and will require storage as below.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=49%>Undo/Redo Buffer</TD>
<TD width=51%>When an operation proceeds, the undo/redo buffer obviously contains the prior dataset.  For operations like transforms, that can be a pretty big object (see below)</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>To clear the undo/redo buffer, just save the document (via File Save). This can potentially free up large amounts of memory.</P>

<P>Memory requirements per data point</P>

<P>When an object is a dataset, it occupies approximately 8 times its length.  Thus, a 16K measurement will take up 8*16K = 128K Bytes of virtual memory.  Put it another way, every 8 datasets take up 1MB.  If you instead use a 128K measurement the storage requirement balloons to 1MB per dataset!</P>
