<H1><A NAME="28q0qzo"></A>Calculate Response command (Network menu, for Networks)</H1>

<P>Use this command to perform the response calculation for the current network.  The response is based on the impedance of each passive component as well as the measured impedance (Impedance) and response (On Axis) of each driver.</P>

<P>This command will also calculate input impedance of the network - if so selected in the <A HREF="spkr3v1r.htm">network properties dialog</A>.  Other options include generating individual frequency response results for each driver and creating an overview chart with all responses displayed.  All of these options are in Network Properties (and get saved with the Document).</P>

<P>This command brings up the Calculate Response dialog.  Pressing OK creates or replaces datasets named <I>mynetwork</I>.Total Freq and <I>mynetwork</I>.Impedance.  It may also create or replace <I>mydriver</I>.Freq datasets for each driver.</P>
