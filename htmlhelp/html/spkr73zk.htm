<H1><A NAME="3doz2zp"></A>Pulse Response command (Measure menu for Drivers)</H1>

<P>Use this command to measure the pulse response of the driver in the enclosure. </P>

<P>The measurement is performed by sending an MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) wave out through the sound board.  The resulting source input wave becomes the pulse response. This measurement is not gated. It uses only one channel of input, as well.</P>

<P>Change the volume, the length of the sequence, and other settings in the Options Preferences dialog. </P>

<P>This command is strictly optional and mainly for post mortem (long after the recording) analysis of data.</P>

<P>This command changes the current properties of the driver, inserting a new dataset entry into one slot.</P>
