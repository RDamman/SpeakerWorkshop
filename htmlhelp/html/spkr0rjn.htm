<H1><A NAME="f.iqvs"></A>Calibrate Dialog (Options Calibrate)</H1>

<P>Use this dialog to select (or create) calibration curves for the system.  There are two calibration curves: the microphone calibration and the channel calibration.  Both are optional, although a microphone will always require a calibration for accurate results.</P>

<P>Fields:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=487>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=38%>Channel Difference</TD>
<TD width=62%>The amount that left and right differ (by frequency in dB)</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=38%>Microphone Response</TD>
<TD width=62%>The difference between the mic response and flat (by frequency in dB).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=38%>Amplifier Reference Response</TD>
<TD width=62%>The pulse response of the amplifier + sound card combination (by time).</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Actions:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=487>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=38%>Test</TD>
<TD width=62%>Click the Test button to have the response tested.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=38%>None</TD>
<TD width=62%>Click the None button to use no calibration curve.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=38%>Browse</TD>
<TD width=62%>Select from the set of available response curves.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Results: </P>

<P>The calibration curves selected or created are saved when the current document is saved. Calibrations are linked to the current document because calibration curves are members of the document.</P>

<P>Clicking a test button executes a calibration wizard.  This simple step by step process walks through the test.</P>

<P>Comment:</P>

<P>Although you can cancel this dialog and not accept changes, test measurements that occur in the system folder are not undoable. Thus, if you use the default channel calibration (System\Measurement.Calib) you can not really cancel the measurement once it has taken place. If you want to be able to cancel, make a copy of the calibration before proceeding through a test cycle.</P>

<P>Note: </P>

<P>In order to get a valid microphone response chart you will need to import one provided by the microphone manufacturer.  See the section on import data formats.</P>
