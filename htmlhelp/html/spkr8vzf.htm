<P>Now that the known resistors have been measured those measurements are used to calculate the impedance jig series resistance and reference resistance. </P>

<P>If you think these values are way wrong you can either</P>

<P>)press cancel and try again</P>

<P>)check the measurements by click the Show me button</P>

<P>If you aren’t sure about the measurements you might want to click the Show me button and see what was measured and what the new measurements imply.</P>

<P>If you like the calculations, just press Finish and the values will be stored into the Impedance Jig definition (in the preferences dialog).</P>
