<H1><A NAME="analmj"></A>Calibrate Impedance Jig   Wizard Dialog (Options Preferences Impedance)</H1>

<P>Use this wizard to calibrate your <A HREF="spkr5z01.htm">impedance jig</A>. The best way to create an impedance jig is with a good stability (but not necessarily high precision) reference resistor and very low impedance connections (good solder joints where usable and binding posts or equivalent for the unknown.</P>

<P>Before you start this test, make sure that your values for reference resistor and series resistance in the impedance jig definition are good guesses. The values don’t have to be very accurate, but they should not be way off (or left at the default of 0).</P>

<P>In order to best calibrate your impedance jig, you should have at least 2 very high precision resistors. This wizard will “test” those two resistors and use their known values to calculate the value of the reference resistor you are using. You can use more resistors to produce a more precise calculation (less average noise).</P>

<P>This method is better than using a known resistor and entering its value by hand because it includes the unknowns such as the resistance of your solder joints, the impedance of the wiring, and the impedance of the test connection.</P>

<P>This wizard will</P>

<P>)test the first resistor</P>

<P>)test the second resistor</P>

<P>)summarize the results then let you test more resistors or take the results and save them into the jig definition (or cancel)</P>
