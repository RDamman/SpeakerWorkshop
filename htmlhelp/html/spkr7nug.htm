<H1><A NAME="ac.qm8"></A>The Main Screen Display</H1>

<P>The main screen consists of a number of (possible) windows.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm1.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>On the left is the <B>Project Tree</B>.  This is movable and resizable.  Double click an item in the project tree to open its window on the left.  Right click to get a menu of options.  Drag to move resources from one folder to the next.</P>

<P>On the right are the resource (item) windows.  Windows generally show graphics (called Charts).  Any chart can show more than one data item and charts are easy to manipulate with the mouse.  Charts are limited to 2 billion data points.</P>

<P>On top is the <B>Menu</B>.  The inner entries of the menu will change depending on which view is on top (which resource you are looking at).  In addition to the general commands (such as file save) each resource type has a set of resource specific commands (such as Record for signals).</P>

<P>Just below the menu is the Speaker Workshop <B>Toolbar</B>.  These buttons are shortcuts to commands from the menu. There is a secondary toolbar that shows up depending on which resource you are currently looking at. This toolbar contains tools specific to the resource – it is called the <B>Resource Bar</B>.</P>

<P>Below the view is the <B>Status Bar</B>. The far left portion of the status bar shows help about the current command. Next to the help are 5 fields. When you move the cursor around in a chart the first three fields show Frequency, Amplitude, and Phase. The next two fields are only used when you move around in an impedance chart. In that case the fields show equivalent impedance. The first field is capacitance / inductance. The second field is the series resistance.</P>

<P>The Project Tree and theToolbars can be detached, moved, and/or hidden easily. To detach a bar pick it up by an area outside its display area and move it into the view window. To attach it back again just drag the bar into its original docking area. To hide a view look at the View menu.</P>
