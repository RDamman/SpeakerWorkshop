<P>Designing a speaker can be broken down into a few steps.</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=543>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Select Speaker Type</TD>
<TD width=67%>The most common types of speakers are 2-way (woofer and tweeter), 3-way (woofer, midrange and tweeter) and subwoofer (just a big woofer in a box).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Select Drivers</TD>
<TD width=67%>Based on the type of speaker, pick drivers to attain a flat response.  You can prototype low frequency response (woofer and midrange) using the Enclosure commands before buying these drivers.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Buy the Drivers</TD>
<TD width=67%>Purchase the drivers and wait for them to arrive.  Create Driver resources to hold the measurement data.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Measure the Drivers</TD>
<TD width=67%>For the woofer and midrange measure impedance in free air and in a prototype box  Calculate T/S parameters for the woofer and midrange.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Design the enclosure</TD>
<TD width=67%>Use the T/S parameters to design a final enclosure for the drivers.  Build one.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Measure the Drivers</TD>
<TD width=67%>Mount all of the drivers in the final enclosure and measure their impedance and frequency response.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Design the Crossover</TD>
<TD width=67%>Using the measurements from the real enclosure use the Network commands to prototype a crossover.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=33%>Test the crossover</TD>
<TD width=67%>Use the Signal commands to verify operation of the crossover with a load resistor, then attach the crossover to the drivers and test the frequency response of the system.</TD>
</TR>
