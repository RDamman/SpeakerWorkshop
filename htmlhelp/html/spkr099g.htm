<H2><A NAME="kig4bd"></A>Drivers tab (Network Properties dialog)</H2>

<P>This page contains settings for the drivers in the network. Networks can contain more than 1 driver (and more than 1 of each kind of driver). Select a driver in the driver list to edit the driver's properties, or use Add/Remove to change the driver complement.</P>

<P>Driver List</P>

<P>This is a list of drivers in the network.  Click</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=439>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=31%>Remove</TD>
<TD width=69%>Remove a selected driver from the network.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=31%>Add new</TD>
<TD width=69%>Add a new driver to the network - brings up the Select a Driver dialog..</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Each driver in the network has a number of editable properties.  They are:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=439>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=31%>Name</TD>
<TD width=69%>The display name of the driver. This can be different from the actual name of the driver.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=31%>Offset</TD>
<TD width=69%>The linear offset of the driver.  This is relative to other drivers in the network and allows for sloped cabinets and physical driver offsets.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=31%>Flip Polarity</TD>
<TD width=69%>Select this to simulate connecting the driver flipped (plus to ground, minus to signal). For crossovers where one driver may be connected out of phase.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=31%>Individual response</TD>
<TD width=69%>Check this to have Speaker Workshop calculate the driver's individual response when calculating the total network response. This is used with the automatic overview chart feature.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>In addition, each driver's location and connections can be edited via:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=439>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Nodes</TD>
<TD width=79%>Which nodes this driver is connected to</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=21%>Position</TD>
<TD width=79%>X,Y location of the driver</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Node numbers are constantly recalculated, and are only valid during this dialog.  Connections based on the node numbers are sticky, however. Position information is based on a maximum size of 1024x1024 for the network.</P>

<P>Obviously node numbers and locations are more easily set with the mouse in the network display using drag and drop.  See editing networks with the mouse.</P>
