<H1><A NAME="14a10vu"></A>How to Measure T/S Parameters</H1>

<P>T/S parameters are named after two scientists (Neville Thiele and Richard Small) who wrote the seminal papers about enclosure design.  T/S Parameters are a few parameters that together determine what size enclosure a driver requires.</P>

<P>T/S Parameters include QMS, QES, FS, RE, VAS and others.</P>

<P>You can get T/S parameters from driver datasheets, but in our experience these values are only a guide to the driver.  To find out the actual T/S parameters for a driver you must measure them. You don’t actually measure T/S parameters, you measure driver impedance(s) and then calculate the T/S parameters based on the measured impedances.</P>

<H2>Step by Step using Delta Compliance (Sealed Box)</H2>

<P><I>for all steps the assumption is that you have created a driver resource and the driver window is opened and on top</I></P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=571>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>1. Free Air Impedance</TD>
<TD width=72%>Measure the driver impedance in free air using the <B>Measure Impedance in Free Air</B> command(see <A HREF="spkr9e73.htm">Measuring Driver Impedance</A>).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>2. Build a Test Box</TD>
<TD width=72%>Build a simple box for the driver whose internal volume is approximately 1/3 to ½ the manufacturer’s VAS.  This box needs to be airtight when the driver is mounted, but otherwise the dimensions and appearance are irrelevant.
<P>Mount the driver to the outside of the box.</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>3. Enter Volume</TD>
<TD width=72%>Open the window for the driver you are measuring.
<P>Select <B>Edit Properties</B>, go to the Data tab and set the Sealed Volume entry to match the volume of your test box.</P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>4. Sealed Impedance</TD>
<TD width=72%>Select <B>Measure Impedance in Sealed Box</B> and measure it.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>5. Set Markers</TD>
<TD width=72%>Examine the two impedance charts, <I>mydriver</I>.Free Air and <I>mydriver</I>.Sealed. Drag the impedance markers to enclose only good data (usually there will be garbage at both ends of the spectrum).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>6. Calculate the T/S parameters.</TD>
<TD width=72%>Select <B>Driver Estimate Parameters…</B> - pick the frequency range based on markers and wait for it to complete (this may take a while for high resolution measurements).  This goes through an iterative optimization process that usually (but not always) finds the T/S parameters to a high level of accuracy.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>You can omit steps 2,3,4 if you do not want to calculate Vas but instead will use published data. We recommend you check Vas, but it is optional.</P>

<P>If you want to check the results, bring up the <A HREF="spkr55bd.htm">Driver Properties Dialog</A> and examine the parameters.  Compare to manufacturers specifications - errors of up to 30% in Qts, VAS and Fs are not uncommon.</P>

<P>If you want to see how the model fits the data, just open the <I>mydriver</I>.Free Air dataset, then right click (to get the popup menu) and select Add data…  Pick the <I>mydriver</I>.Estimate dataset.  Now the Free Air chart will also show the mathematical estimate and you can compare the two.</P>

<H2>Step by Step using Added Mass (Delta Mass)</H2>
