<H1><A NAME="tvj1on"></A>Gated Response command (Measure menu, for Signals)</H1>

<P>Use this command to measure the gated frequency response of a speaker. This command generates an MLS signal out.  The resultant single channel input is gated by the time markers, analyzed, and then any channel and microphone calibration are applied.</P>

<P>The actual Signal used to measure this response is the System signal in the System folder, where the .in.l and .in.r datasets will be created during this measurement. Signal settings are defined in the Options Preferences dialog.</P>

<P>This command creates or replaces a dataset named <I>mysignal</I>.Gated.  It also changes a number of datasets in the System folder.</P>
