<H1><A NAME="2crjz0s"></A>Sound Card Calibration</H1>

<P>Calibrating your sound card is something that you should always do at least once. The Speaker Workshop automatic calibration routines are quite accurate and at worst may be useful as a starting point. </P>

<P>There are 3 different calibration tests:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=543>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=39%>Channel Difference</TD>
<TD width=61%>This uses a loop cable to find the differences between the left and right input channels.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=39%>Sound Card Source Impedance</TD>
<TD width=61%>This measures the input resistance and capacitance of your sound card.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=39%>Impedance Jig</TD>
<TD width=61%>This test uses calibration resistors to find the actual resistances for your impedance jig.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><BR>

<P>Note that a single impedance jig with 3 reference resistors (short, 10 ohms, and 10K ohms) is sufficient to handle all three calibration sequences. The shorted jig suffices as a loop cable in the channel difference test. The jig with a 10K reference can be used for the source impedance test. The impedance jig test uses the normal 10 ohm (or so) reference.</P>

<H2>Step by Step Calibration</H2>

<P>1.Channel difference - select the <B>Options Calibrate</B> command and press the <B>Test</B> button under channel calibration.  The directions will call for a <A HREF="spkr4bxb.htm">loop cable</A> plugged into the sound card input and output.</P>

<P>1.Sound Card Source Impedance - execute the <B>Options Preferences</B> command and select the <B>Impedance</B> tab. Press the <B>Test</B> button in the Sound Card Source Impedance group. The instructions will call for using a cable with a 10K series resistor.  You can also use an impedance jig with a 10K reference.</P>

<P>1.Impedance Jig - execute the <B>Options Preferences</B> command and select the <B>Impedance</B> tab. Press the <B>Test</B> button in the Impedance Jig group. The instructions call for setting up the impedance jig as in normal use.  The sound card is calibrated by examining 2 or more known resistors and then estimating the best fit reference resistance and series resistance.  Even if you think you know your impedance jig values try this at least once.</P>
