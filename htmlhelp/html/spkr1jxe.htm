<H1><A NAME="17x6fgb"></A>Impedance command (Measure menu for Drivers)</H1>

<P>Use this command to measure the final impedance of the driver in the enclosure.  The impedance of the driver is calculated using the <A HREF="spkr5z01.htm">Impedance Jig</A>, and the final result is slotted into the Impedance slot for the driver.</P>

<P>The measurement is performed by sending an MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) wave out through the sound board.  The resulting input waves (source and reference) are then analyzed and combined to produce a final impedance curve.</P>

<P>Change the volume, the length of the sequence, and other settings in the Options Preferences dialog.</P>

<P>This command is a necessary part of testing and prototyping a driver/enclosure combination.  It is required for any driver that will require a crossover.</P>

<P>This command changes the current properties of the driver, inserting a new dataset entry into one slot.</P>
