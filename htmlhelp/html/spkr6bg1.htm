<P>A Folder is a place to put resources (including other folders).  They are simply a way to compartmentalize data.  Because it takes you time to switch between folders, we recommend that you use folders only with larger projects or for special purposes.  Also, for display reasons, we recommend that you use short folder names (do not use<B> Focal 10V516 Driver Tests for 1/3/96</B> as a name, for example).</P>

<P>One very good use for folders is as a place to store measurements of slightly different configurations.  For example, when optimizing a crossover you might want to store the actual measurements for each iteration in a folder.</P>

<P>The <I>System</I> folder is a special holding place for Speaker Workshop.  In this folder are stored the MLS signal used for the last measurement, as well as intermediate results of the last measurement.  For example, if you are measuring impedance, then the time measurement data and the frequency response calculated data would be stored here. The intermediate results are kept here so that you can refer to them if you have questions about a measurement. </P>

<P>Note that for storage reasons the datasets in the System folder are not subject to Undo processing.</P>
