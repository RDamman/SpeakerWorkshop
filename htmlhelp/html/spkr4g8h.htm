<H1><A NAME="1omugq"></A>Microphone Response command (Measure menu, for Signals)</H1>

<P>Use this command to measure the ungated frequency response of a speaker. This command generates an MLS signal out.  Because this is acoustic the input signal is taken starting at the time gate start value. It is not gated to the time gate end value, however.</P>

<P>The resultant single channel input is analyzed, then any channel and microphone calibration are applied.</P>

<P>The actual Signal used to measure this response is the System signal in the System folder, where the .in.l and .in.r datasets will be created during this measurement. Signal settings are defined in the Options Preferences dialog.</P>

<P>This command creates or replaces a dataset named <I>mysignal</I>.Mic.  It also changes a number of datasets in the System folder.</P>
