<H1><A NAME="khg5h7"></A>Merge Port Response command<BR>
(Calculate menu for Enclosures<BR>
 Driver menu for Drivers)</H1>

<P>Use this command to merge a port response and a nearfield response for a ported enclosure. This uses the two response sets along with the known areas of the port and the driver to add the two responses together appropriately.</P>

<P>Ensure that your piston area (in the driver specification) and your port area are accurate before executing this command. Also, make sure you measure the two responses (nearfield driver and nearfield port) using exactly the same volume settings – so that the two responses are comparable.</P>

<P>See the <A HREF="spkr7394.htm">Merge Port Response dialog</A> for more information.</P>
