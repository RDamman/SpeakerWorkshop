<H1><A NAME="2ggy06p"></A>Loop Record command (Sound menu, for Signals)</H1>

<P>Use this command to record data continuously while playing a signal through the sound board.  This command does not bring up the record dialog, but it does use the settings from a previous record command.</P>

<P>The type of signal and the sampling rate are selected in the <A HREF="spkr7f1k.htm">Signal Properties dialog</A></P>

<P>The record time data is stored as <I>mysignal</I>.in.l and <I>mysignal</I>.in.r.</P>

<P>To simplify use, the Edit menu Show options become available to display results quickly.  Alternately, the input datasets can be viewed in another window.  </P>

<P>Set the Show option to an input channel to use the program as an audio grade oscilloscope.  This command is also often used to calibrate volume settings for the sound board.</P>

<P>To <B>stop</B> the recording process select Sound Stop Everything.</P>
