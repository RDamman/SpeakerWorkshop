<P>Speaker Workshop requires </P>

<P>1) a computer that can run Windows 95 (trademark Microsoft)</P>

<P>1) a sound card that can handle <A HREF="spkr0mhr.htm">full duplex</A> audio </P>

<P>1) a numeric coprocessor (i.e. a 486 or better or a 386/387 combo)</P>

<P>In addition, we strongly recommend that you have a Pentium class processor or better if you want high resolution results.</P>

<P>About the requirements:</P>

<P><I>If your sound card can not handle full duplex audio</I>, then you will be unable to test driver impedance and frequency response using Speaker Workshop.  That does not stop you from using some of the advanced features of the program, such as enclosure design and crossover design.  Simply import frequency response and impedance data, or enter the necessary T/S parameters (for enclosure design) manually.</P>

<P>We do strongly recommend that you obtain a full duplex sound card.  It will enhance your enjoyment of the product substantially.  </P>

<P>Speaker Workshop has provisions for testing sound cards for compatability. Just run Options / Wizard / <A HREF="spkr0rfn.htm">Check Sound Card</A> to test a card for full duplex.  Note that most full duplex sound cards require two dma channels.  Also, some boards have a half-duplex / full-duplex software switch in the Control Panel’s System option.</P>

<P>A word about precision…</P>

<P>Speaker Workshop is only as precise as your hardware (and other test cables).  With even a moderate quality sound card you can measure distortion down to .1% and measure impedance and passive component values to 1%.  If you set up the system correctly and build the cables correctly, then Speaker Workshop will perform superbly with good hardware.</P>

<P>For more information on building good cables see <A HREF="spkr08tk.htm">Cables and Connectors</A></P>
