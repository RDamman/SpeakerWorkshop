<P>This page contains miscellaneous parameters used throughout Speaker Workshop. Currently this contains:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=427>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Unit of Measure</TD>
<TD width=72%>Select English (inches, feet, cu. Ft.) or Metric (cm., Meters, liters). You can change this on a field basis by just clicking the unit displayed. The unit of measure will cycle through the choices as you click it</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Country Code</TD>
<TD width=72%>Enter a 1 to use your local date, time, and number formats. Enter a 0 to use Ansi-English formats.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Single click opens resources</TD>
<TD width=72%>Click this on so that when you click a resource in the tree with the mouse it is opened. If this is off you need to double-click a resource to open it.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Open last document at startup</TD>
<TD width=72%>This will automatically open whatever file you last had open when you start up Speaker Workshop. Otherwise Speaker Workshop starts up with a blank document.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Verbose Status Display</TD>
<TD width=72%>Click this on to have the status display in the lower right corner of the window show the unit of measure (Hz, Ohms, etc.). Otherwise the status display is more concise and smaller.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>48kHz Sample Rate Checking</TD>
<TD width=72%>Click this off if you are having problems with 48kHz sampling rates. This checkbox is specifically for the Creative Labs SB16 and AWE64 cards.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>AutoSave every xxx minutes</TD>
<TD width=72%>Check this on to have autosave enabled. Fill in the field with the number of minutes between autosaves. A document named <I>myfile</I>.swd will then be saved to <I>myfile</I>.$.swd every xxx minutes once the document is modified.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Driver and Enclosure Info Font</TD>
<TD width=72%>Select the font to be used in the tabular information presented in the Driver and Enclosure resource views. A nice small font fits lots of data whereas a larger font is perhaps more readable. This font will also be used when printing the view (File / Print).</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">
<TD width=28%>Number of Past Measurements to Keep</TD>
<TD width=72%>Set this to a number greater than 0 to have Speaker Workshop create trails. A trail is created when you execute a measurement (such as On-Axis response) more than once. A file mydriver.OnAxis.trl1 is created containing the last measurements and a chart is created showing the current and last measurement. This lets you compare measurements as you change component values or move a microphone around or change gating. Trails are temporary and are not saved (in fact, when you save the trails are deleted). To make a trail dataset permanent right-click it in the tree and select the Make Permanent option. It will still be overwritten by new trails so renaming it is a good idea.</TD>
