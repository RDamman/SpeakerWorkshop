<P>A driver is the description of a physical speaker driver.  A Focal 10V516J driver, for example, is a 10 inch woofer with a resonant frequency (FS) of 22.3 and a total Q (QTS) of  0.39.</P>

<P>When prototyping enclosures, drivers are defined by their Thiele/Small (T/S) parameters, such as QTS.  When prototyping crossovers, drivers are defined by their measured parameters (in particular, impedance and frequency response).</P>

<P>To find the T/S parameters for a driver you can either manually enter the parameters (for prototyping enclosures before you purchase a driver) or you can use the Calculate Parameters command once the impedance of the driver is measured.  These measurements are made in free air and in a sample enclosure. Some parameters (such as efficiency) must be entered by hand.  For more information, see Measuring T/S parameters.</P>

<P>To measure the frequency response and impedance of a driver (for use with crossover prototyping) you should measure the final frequency response and impedance of the driver in the enclosure.  See the section on measuring frequency response.</P>
