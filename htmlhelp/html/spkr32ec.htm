<H1><A NAME="5fu12d"></A>Redo command (Edit menu)</H1>

<P>Use this command to redo the last undone action.   The name of the command changes, depending on what the last undone action was.  The Redo command will be grayed if there is nothing to redo.</P>

<P>Note: the redo command does not re-execute the last undone action, it just puts the document back the way it was prior to the last undo.  For example, redoing a Record operation will just put the datasets previously recorded back into the document - it will not re-record more data.</P>
