<P>A network is a set of voltage sources, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and drivers.  Networks are usually used as a way to prototype crossovers.  Speaker Workshop can find the frequency (acoustic) response of a network and the input impedance of a network.  Speaker Workshop also has provisions for optimizing the network by varying components so that you can easily attain a desired acoustic response.</P>

<P>For each driver in the network, Speaker Workshop examines the final frequency response and impedance when calculating network response.</P>
