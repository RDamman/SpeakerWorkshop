<P>A chart is a pictorial representation of data. Speaker Workshop always uses line charts to display data. In general, the X-axis is Frequency or Time and the Y-axes are Amplitude and Phase. Most of a chart is customizable - fonts, colors, axes, gridlines, etc. All charts can contain multiple datasets.</P>

<P>Speaker Workshop currently has two different kinds of charts. They look the same and are treated similarly, but they have slight differences.</P>

<P>The first kind of chart is that shown when you open a dataset resource. This is a <I>local</I> chart. You can edit this chart as much as you like, but the changes are not saved with the document. The chart itself is not named and is not shown in the project tree.</P>

<P>The second kind of chart is that created when you select the Resource New Chart command. This is a <I>global</I> chart, and its settings are saved in the document. The chart is named and is shown in the project tree.</P>

<P>The reason for the two kinds of charts:</P>

<P>) it saves storage to not save a full chart definition with each dataset</P>

<P>) it is easy to mess up and remove the primary dataset from the local chart as well as perform other operations (setting limits, for example) that make the local chart useless for seeing the dataset. As a result, when you reload the document the local chart is rebuilt as appropriate for viewing its dataset.</P>

<P>¨If you want a permanent custom chart, create it via Resource New Chart.</P>
