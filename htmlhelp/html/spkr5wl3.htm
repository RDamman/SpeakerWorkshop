<H1><A NAME="7v_hsw"></A>Show Measurement Values - Calibrate Impedance Jig   Wizard </H1>

<P>Use this dialog to examine the values measured by Speaker Workshop during the calibration. Because Speaker Workshop estimates the values of the resistors based on multiple frequency measurements it is possible that SW could make a mistake. This dialog lets you check that.</P>

<P>Prior to beginning this test you had values for reference resistor and series resistance. The first column shows the known values being measured. The second column shows the resistance measurements using the old values. The third column of data shows the measurements using SW’s new calculated reference and series resistance values. </P>

<P>Assuming that your pre-estimates of reference and series resistance were near correct, that second column should be pretty much the known values. If any of that column is way off then perhaps SW made a mistake. The third column will always agree with the known values if you measure two resistors.</P>

<P>For more information, see the first page: <A HREF="spkr9b56.htm">Calibrate Impedance Jig</A></P>
