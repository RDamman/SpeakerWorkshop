<P>Use the settings on this page to place the markers for each type of dataset as well as to make makers visible or invisible. When visible on a chart, markers are displayed as thick red vertical lines.</P>

<P>You can also move markers on-screen using the mouse with a press-drag motion.</P>

<P>Markers are used within Speaker Workshop for two primary tasks.</P>

<P>1) Both Time Markers are used for all gated acoustic measurements - such as Measure Driver On-Axis.</P>

<P>1) Markers are useful as quick ways to restrict operations to a consistent range. All dialogs that are based on a range (such as FFT) allow markers to define the range - this can be a serious keystroke-saver.</P>
