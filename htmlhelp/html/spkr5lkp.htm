<P>A dataset is a quantity of measured data.  For example, the frequency response of a driver is kept as a dataset.  The measured impedance of a driver is a dataset.  In general, a dataset is indexed by frequency (response vs frequency, impedance vs frequency, …).</P>

<P>The dataset display is a chart of the data vs frequency (vs time for time data). This display can easily be changed via the Chart Properties command.  It can also be changed by a number of mouse operations (see <A HREF="spkr1md0.htm">Editing Charts with the mouse</A>).  </P>

<P>Speaker Workshop limits datasets to approximately 2 billion data points.  This should be enough for most users.  Note that the bigger the dataset the slower Speaker Workshop will run.  Also, large datasets can quickly balloon the saved file size.</P>
