<P>A Signal is a waveform that can be played.  Signals are usually defined as Sine, Square, etc. and their parameters are set in the Edit Properties command.</P>

<P>Speaker Workshop uses MLS signals for most of the driver testing.  This is a pseudo-random signal that acts like a frequency sweep.  The more samples the better the frequency resolution.  Higher sampling rates let you measure higher frequencies.  These parameters are all set in the Options Preferences command.</P>

<P>When recording a signal, the dataset that is charted is selected in the View menu.  This lets you chart the input signal while recording - i.e. act like an oscilloscope.</P>

<P>In Speaker Workshop, signals are always played in Mono.</P>
